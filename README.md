# Weather App
A simple and responsive weather application built with React and Vite, utilizing the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch and display real-time weather data based on user input or geolocation.
About the Project
# This Weather App allows users to:

Search for current weather conditions by city name
View weather details including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather description
Toggle between Celsius and Fahrenheit units
Access weather data based on their current location
Enjoy a fast and modern development experience powered by Vite

The project is built with React for a dynamic UI and Vite for fast development and optimized production builds. It leverages the OpenWeatherMap API for accurate weather data.
# Technologies Used

React: JavaScript library for building user interfaces
Vite: Next-generation frontend tooling for fast development and builds
TypeScript (optional): For type-safe JavaScript development
Axios: Promise-based HTTP client for API requests
Tailwind CSS: Utility-first CSS framework for styling
OpenWeatherMap API: Provides real-time weather data

# Setup / Installation
Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/weather-app.git
cd weather-app


Install DependenciesEnsure you have Node.js installed. Then run:
npm install


Set Up Environment VariablesCreate a .env file in the project root and add your OpenWeatherMap API key:
VITE_API_KEY=your_openweathermap_api_key
VITE_API_URL=https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5
VITE_ICON_URL=https://openweathermap.org/img/w

To obtain an API key, sign up at OpenWeatherMap and generate a key from your account dashboard.

Run the Development ServerStart the Vite development server:
npm run dev

The app will be available at http://localhost:5173.

# Usage

Search Weather: Enter a city name in the search bar and press Enter to view current weather conditions.
Geolocation: Allow location access to automatically fetch weather data for your current location.
Unit Toggle: Switch between Celsius and Fahrenheit using the toggle button.
Error Handling: Displays an error message if the city is not found or if there’s an issue with the API.

# Approach

React Components: The app uses functional components with hooks (useState, useEffect) for state management and API calls.
Vite: Leverages Vite’s fast development server and Hot Module Replacement (HMR) for an efficient developer experience.
API Integration: Uses Axios to make asynchronous requests to the OpenWeatherMap API, with environment variables to securely store the API key.
Styling: Tailwind CSS provides responsive and utility-first styling for a clean and modern UI.
